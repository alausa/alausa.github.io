<p> <i>   I believe when you are determined and work hard towards it you achieve alot in life, Although have achieve alot in life but still hope and pray to achieve more than i have . one of my achievement that i can never forget in my entire life was when i was in SS2, I was given an award as the over-all best student which was my dream. when i got the award i was happy and am proud of myself. i couldnt believe i will get the award because there alot of people that are more better than me in class but when i determined and work hard towards my determination i got what have been dreaming for. thats why i always say to myself that i will never underestimate myself.   Another achievement was when i was in Primary school, when i was little and running on a race track at school, I always run as fast as i could because it was my dream in life to steadily raised my level of aspiration and expectation because i belived no one ever achieve greatness in life without dreams. i makes my dream become reality by earned a lot of respect, victory and prides from an academicians on my performance on road track, i also impressed my parent, colleagues and my close aquitances on race track competition which was on of great achievement in my life. <br> Morever, After i completed my primary and secondary school, i was given pride on my performance on my west african examination council (WAEC) and i was also given senior secondary school certificate SSCE Which impressed me to did JAMB in the following year and later got admission to KWARA STATE UNIVERSITY to studied Library and Information science which saves as one of my great achievement in life.....<br> <br>
